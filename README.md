# Parking-Spot-Detection


## Overview
Parking Spot Detection is a computer vision project utilizing OpenCV and the SCV (Statistical Classification Vector) algorithm to identify vacant and occupied parking spaces in a given area. This project is designed to enhance smart parking solutions by enabling real-time detection and monitoring of parking spots.

## Features
- **Real-time detection** of parking spot occupancy using image processing.
- **Uses OpenCV** for efficient image analysis.
- **SCV algorithm** for classifying parking spots.
- **Configurable parameters** for adaptability to different parking environments.
